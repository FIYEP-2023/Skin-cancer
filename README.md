# Bachelor of Science in Data Science, ITU Copenhagen 2022/23 - First Year Project
## Second project: analysis of skin lesions  
  
# Running the code
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The code works with python 3.9 (but most likely also in newer versions).  
To generate figures, run `python main.py --figures`. Note that some of the figures rely on the image data and our segmentation of them, which is not present in the repository.  
## Running the code - Single image mode  
We implement the [classify](https://github.com/vcheplygina/fyp2023/blob/0c12126ef8013e4f95e9cec99ec0007d5a55d974/03_evaluate_classifier.py#LL11C25-L11C25) function in [03_evaluate_classifier.py](./03_evaluate_classifier.py#L19). This function takes an image and a mask, then prints and returns both the predicted class and the probability/confidence.
## Running the code - Batch mode  
To run the finished model on some data, put the images in the "EVAL_IMGS" directory in the following format:
```bash
some_image_name.png
some_image_name_mask.png
```
Then run `python main.py --predict`  
**Optionally** include metadata: a .csv file with columns "img_id" and "diagnostic", a .npy two-dimensional numpy array with columns `["img_id.png", "diagnostic"]` or a .pkl numpy array with the same properties.  
Put this metadata file into "EVAL_IMGS".  
Predictions will be saved into a .npy and .csv file in "EVAL_RESULTS", as well as printed to the console and saved in "log.txt".  
If metadata is included, stats such as recall, f1-score and confusion matrix will also be printed to the console.
